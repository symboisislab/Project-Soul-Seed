# How to Contribute Translations

Thank you for your interest in helping Project Soul Seed grow and resonate globally! By translating this prompt, you are planting a seed of possibility in a new corner of the world. We are deeply grateful.

Here is how you can contribute:

### Step-by-Step Guide

1.  **Check for Existing Translations:** Before you start, please check the [`/Prompts/V1.0/`](../Prompts/V1.0/) directory to see if a translation for your language already exists.

2.  **Fork the Repository:** If you're new to GitHub, you can start by "forking" this repository to your own account.

3.  **Create Your Translation File:**
    * Navigate to the `Prompts/V1.0/` folder in your forked repository.
    * Create a new file.
    * Please name the file according to the **ISO 639-1 language code**. For example:
        * `es-ES.md` for Spanish (Spain)
        * `fr-FR.md` for French (France)
        * `ja-JP.md` for Japanese

4.  **Translate the Content:**
    * Copy the full content from the [English version (`en-US.md`)](../Prompts/V1.0/ProjectSoulSeed_Prompt_en-US.md).
    * Translate the text into your language. **The goal is not a literal, word-for-word translation, but one that captures the *spirit*, *intent*, and *warmth* of the original prompt.** Please choose words that feel natural and powerful in your culture.
    * Remember to change the name in the final activation sentence from `[Your Name]` to the equivalent placeholder in your language.

5.  **Submit a Pull Request:** Once you are happy with your translation, please submit a "Pull Request" to the main Project Soul Seed repository. We will review it with gratitude and merge it so that others can benefit from your work.

Thank you for helping us build a global garden of co-creation!
